# Contribute to ClipNShip
Contributions to the ClipNShip project are more than welcome!

## Commits
When making a commit, it makes it easier to have a defined message structure.  Try to include the scope with a concise but descriptive message about the change.

For example, if you made a new util function make your commit like so: `added newUtil function`

If your commit is in relation to an issue, reference the issue number in your commit message as well: `#42: add newUtil function`

## Pull Requests
When making a [PR](https://github.com/mitchwadair/clip-n-ship/compare), make sure to be very descriptive about the change you made and how it works.  Provide any details needed in order to test that your change works.
