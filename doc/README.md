# ClipNShip Documentation

Here you can find more information on how to use ClipNShip to build your awesome app!

## Install

ClipNShip is a library built for browser use. You can add the module to your page by inserting the following tag in your header:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/mitchwadair/clip-n-ship@1.0.0/dist/clipnship.min.js"></script>
```

Having that tag will expose the `ClipConverter` class to the global scope for your use:

```js
const converter = new ClipConverter(videoURL);
```

## API

More information on the ClipNShip API can be found [here](api.md).
